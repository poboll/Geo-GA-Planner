Figure 1: Study Area Bathymetry Overview

Figure 1. This figure provides an overview of the simulated seafloor topography for the 4×5 NM study area, illustrating a challenging non-uniform mapping environment. Subplot (a) is a 2D contour map with depths color-coded (blue for deep, red for shallow) and 20 evenly spaced contour intervals. Key depth contours are labeled (e.g., “120 m”, “88 m”), highlighting a general slope from about 25 m in the northwest to 175 m in the southeast, overlaid with realistic sinusoidal undulations. Subplot (b) is a 3D surface plot of the same bathymetry, viewed from a low angle (30° elevation, –135° azimuth) looking from the shallow side toward the deep side. The 3D perspective further emphasizes the terrain’s gentle ridges and troughs. Together, these visualizations confirm the complex depth variations of the area (nearly 150 m relief), underscoring the need for an adaptive survey strategy.

Figure 2: Optimized Path Planning Result

Figure 2. This core result figure overlays the optimized AUV survey path on the bathymetric map. The background is the same 2D contour map of the seafloor (using the same depth color scale and contours as in Figure 1a). The yellow vertical lines (with black outlines) represent the planned survey tracks generated by our hybrid optimization method. There are 36 parallel survey lines spanning the area, and their spacing varies adaptively with the terrain: lines are closer together in shallower regions and farther apart in deeper regions. This adaptive layout yields nearly full coverage (99.786%) with only 0.214% unsurveyed area. The high-contrast yellow/black lines stand out clearly against the terrain colors, making it evident how the path avoids gaps while minimizing redundant overlap. (Legend: “Optimized Survey Lines”)

Figure 3: Performance Comparison

Figure 3. This grouped bar chart quantitatively compares our Hybrid Method (blue) against a Fixed-Spacing Baseline (red) on three key performance metrics. The first group shows total survey path length: our method requires only 180 NM of travel, dramatically shorter than the baseline’s 480 NM. The middle group compares the coverage gap (unsurveyed area): both methods achieve nearly complete coverage (our method 0.214% gap vs baseline 0.100%, a small difference). The last group shows average overlap: our adaptive approach restricts overlap to ~15%, whereas the baseline (with a constant line spacing chosen for shallow depths) wastes ~78% in redundant overlap. Error bars are not needed since these values are deterministic results. The chart highlights that our method achieves the same high coverage with a much shorter path and far less redundancy. (The baseline’s only slight advantage is a marginally lower gap, attained at the cost of excessive effort.)

Table 1: Performance Metrics Summary
Table 1 provides a quantitative comparison of our method and the baseline on core metrics, along with the percentage improvement of our method (positive values indicate reduction in the metric relative to baseline). Despite the baseline’s slightly lower gap, our hybrid method achieves the same near-total coverage with a far shorter path and much lower overlap.
Performance Metric	Our Hybrid Method	Fixed-Spacing Baseline	Improvement
Total Path Length (NM)	180	480	62.5% (reduction)
Coverage Gap (%)	0.214%	0.100%	N/A
Average Overlap (%)	15.0%	78.0%	80.8% (reduction)
Note: Improvement values indicate the relative reduction achieved by our method versus the baseline. The baseline method’s slightly lower gap was attained at the cost of a dramatically longer path length and excessive overlap, underscoring its inefficiency in regions with varying depth.
